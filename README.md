## ‚ö†Ô∏è If the start command is not recognized (Windows)

After installing with:

```bash
pip install .
```

you **might not have access to the command** (e.g. `project-pycliapp`) in the terminal if the `Scripts` directory is not added to the `PATH` environment variable.

### ‚úÖ How to fix

Run in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\Scripts"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace `Python.3.13` with your actual version**, if it's different!

This temporarily adds the path for the current session. To make it permanent, either:
- Use Control Panel ‚Üí System ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Or run in PowerShell:
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";<your_scripts_path>", "User")
```
